# Welcome to eosmarket 2.0!

eosmarket.io began as an EOS-native decentralized e-commerce platform, focused on tapping into EOS blockchain's innate advantages. As the community grew and different Pomelo seasons unfolded, our team encountered EOS VM. Recognizing its potential, we decided to rebrand into eosmarket 2.0 and use EOS VM to is full potential.


We will continue to push code through Github in the upcoming days as we get closer to the release date in November 2023 of eosmarket 2.0
